# 🎙️🧠 Speech Emotion Recognition  
### An ML-Based Audio Classification System

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)** system using **machine learning** techniques to classify human emotions from speech signals.  
By analyzing audio features extracted from voice recordings, the model predicts emotional states such as **happy, sad, angry, neutral**, and others.

Speech emotion recognition plays a key role in applications such as human–computer interaction, sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, and conversational AI.


## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Extract meaningful audio features from speech signals  
- Train machine learning models to classify emotional states  
- Evaluate model performance on unseen audio samples  
- Demonstrate end-to-end audio-based emotion classification  


## 🧠 Problem Statement
Human emotions are often conveyed through speech tone, pitch, and intensity rather than words alone.  
Traditional text-based sentiment analysis fails to capture these nuances, making speech-based emotion recognition a challenging yet impactful machine learning problem.

This project aims to model emotional patterns directly from **audio signals** using supervised learning techniques.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - librosa  
  - numpy, pandas  
  - matplotlib, seaborn  
  - scikit-learn  
- **ML Techniques:** Supervised classification  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Python environment  


## 🎧 Feature Engineering
Key audio features extracted from speech samples include:
- Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)  
- Chroma features  
- Spectral contrast  
- Zero-crossing rate  

These features capture frequency, pitch, and energy variations that are critical for emotion recognition.


## 🤖 Modeling Approach
- Audio features are extracted and normalized  
- Labels are encoded for supervised learning  
- Multiple machine learning classifiers are trained and evaluated  
- Model performance is measured using classification metrics  


## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  

These metrics ensure balanced evaluation across emotional classes.


## 🚀 Use Cases
- Emotion-aware virtual assistants  
- Sentiment analysis in voice-based systems  
- Mental health and stress detection  
- Machine learning portfolio project  


## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **machine learning and signal processing** can be combined to interpret emotional cues from speech.  
By focusing on feature engineering and supervised classification, the system highlights the challenges and potential of audio-based emotion recognition.
